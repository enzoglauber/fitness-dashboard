# Technical Assignment: Interactive Fitness Dashboard

## Objective
Build a responsive fitness dashboard application using React, TypeScript, and Vite. This assignment will showcase your skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS, and the ability to work with external libraries.

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

## Installation
To install the project dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm i
```

To start the development server, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the application [here](https://fitness-dashboard-zeta-black.vercel.app/).

## Important Requirement
Please complete this assignment independently without using any code generators or AI tools (such as Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.). Feel free to use Google for documentation and general research purposes.

## Project Overview
You’ll create a fitness dashboard with a weekly workout progress chart, a daily goals checklist, and quick action buttons. This project will demonstrate your ability to use advanced JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, external libraries, and modern front-end tools.

## Requirements

### 1. Project Setup
- **Initialize the Project:** Set up the project using a bundler (like Vite/Webpack/etc.).
- **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript for all components and functions, ensuring type safety throughout the project.

### 2. Features
- **Workout Progress Chart:**
  - Display a weekly workout progress chart using a charting library, like `chart.js` or `recharts`.
  - Configure the library by installing it via npm and incorporating it into the project.

- **Daily Goals Checklist:**
  - Include a dynamically populated checklist of daily goals (e.g., “10,000 steps,” “Drink 2L water”).
  - Use mock data from a JSON file or simulate a fetch call from a mock API.
  - Style the checkboxes with custom CSS, including animations for checking/unchecking items.

- **Quick Actions with Animations:**
  - Create buttons like “Start Workout” and “View Progress,” with visually appealing hover and click effects.
  - Use an animation library (such as `framer-motion`) to enhance interactions.

### 3. Styling Requirements
- **Responsive Layout with CSS Grid:**
  - Use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts between single- and multi-column formats based on screen size.

- **Custom Styling:**
  - Style checkboxes with custom CSS (e.g., circular checkboxes with transitions).
  - Add smooth animations to buttons for hover and click states using CSS animations or transitions.

- **Dark Mode:**
  - Implement a basic dark mode toggle using CSS variables for colors, allowing for easy theme switching.

### 4. Documentation
- Include a brief `README` with:
  - Instructions on installing dependencies and running the project.
  - A list of the npm libraries used and a short note on what each library adds to the project.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on:
1. **Code Quality:** Clean, maintainable code with effective TypeScript usage and clear component structure.
2. **React Proficiency:** Correct use of functional components, hooks, and React state management.
3. **CSS Expertise:** Advanced use of CSS Grid, animations, and custom styles for components.
4. **Library Integration:** Smooth integration and configuration of charting and animation libraries.
5. **Overall Performance:** Fast, responsive application with an optimized Vite setup.

## Submission
Please send a zip file/Github link of the completed project, including the `README`. Ensure that all dependencies are included in `package.json` so we can install and test the project easily.

Let us know if you have any questions before starting. Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your work!
